  <h2>Description</h2>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground cuman</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 can caffeinated soda drink</li>
    <li>3/4 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>8 slices bacon</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup bourbon</li>
    <li>2 cans baked beans</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Mix brown sugar, paprika, mustard, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Whisk in pepper soda, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce until brown sugar is dissolved.</li>
    <li>Cut 4 slices of bacon into small strips. Cook and stir in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until almost crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, reserving bacon grease.</li>
    <li>Stir onion into the bacon grease in the Dutch oven; cook and stir until soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Pour in bourbon, stirring to scrape up browned bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Stir bacon strips back in.</li>
    <li>Pour brown sugar mixture and baked beans into the Dutch oven. Simmer until beans are heated through, about 15 minutes. Arrange remaining 4 slices of bacon on top of the beans.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven, covered, until beans are bubbly and sauce is syrupy, about 2Â½ to 3 hours.</li>
  </ol>
