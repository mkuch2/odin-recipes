    <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>5 stalks green onion</li>

    <li>2 teaspoons pickle juice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>

    <li>Add mayonnaise, onions, celery, pickles, sour cream, mustard, pickle juice, dill, and pepper to a large bowl; stir to combine. Stir in potatoes and eggs until well blended, mashing potatoes very slightly. Season with salt and pepper, adding up to 1 teaspoon more salt, if desired.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with paprika, and garnish with olives. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
